# Voice Cloning

A Python-based voice cloning system that creates synthetic voices using deep learning techniques.

## Overview

This project allows you to clone voices by training a deep learning model on voice samples. It can generate natural-sounding speech in the target voice speaking any input text.

## Features

- Voice sample preprocessing and analysis
- Neural voice modeling using deep learning
- Text-to-speech synthesis in cloned voice
- Support for multiple languages
- Easy-to-use CLI interface

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
